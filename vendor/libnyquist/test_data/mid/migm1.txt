System Requirements:

- MIDI Playback Software capable of reading Type 1 Standard
    MIDI File format

This Standard MIDI File was recorded directly from LucasFilm Game's
"The Secret of Monkey Island" adventure game.  It has been converted
from the MT-32 version for playback on General MIDI sound cards.  A
Wave Table sound card is highly recommended for optimal playback.

Recorded/Converted to Standard MIDI File format by Tom Lewandowski.
